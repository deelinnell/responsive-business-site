This is my first attempt at a large scale website that could theoretically be used for an actual buisness. Modern websites seem to be trending more and more towards having minimal / open looking websites and I've tried to keep that, but also wanting it to be unique and stand out. One interesting feature is a static picture that is hidden most the time by a white background, but several of the components have a window so the picture can be seen as you scroll.

I've also kept responsiveness in mind by implementing the typical features like media query, flexbox / grid, and also a few built in sliders with cards. I've only finished the home page, but I'm planning on add many more pages to make it function like a useable website that a business would be happy to use. I've learned a lot about components so far and also about planning ahead so you're making maximum use of the tools available with react / nextjs.

Not much as been done with state yet, but I'm planning on adding user login in with a shopping cart type feature and data on the user that can be updated or changed. So far making this has given me more of an appreciation for how much time and effort is put into making a large scale website, and I don't even have the pressure of the thought that an actual business would be using this website one day.
