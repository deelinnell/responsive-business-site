#MY-RESPONSIVE-BUSINESS-WEBSITE

This is my first attempt at a large scale website that could theoretically be used for an actual buisness. Modern websites seem to be trending towards having minimal / open looks and I've tried to keep that in mind, but also want it to be unique and stand out. One interesting feature is a static picture that is hidden by a white background most of the time, but several of the components have a window to see it while scrolling past.

I've also kept responsiveness in mind by implementing the typical features like media query, flexbox / grid, and also a few built in sliders with cards. I've only finished the home page, but I'm planning on adding many more pages to make it a fully functioning website that could be useable by an actual business. I've learned a lot about components so far and about planning ahead so you're making maximum use of the tools available with react / nextjs.

I haven't done much with state yet, but I'm planning on adding user login features with a shopping cart and data on the users that can be updated or changed. So far making this has given me more of an appreciation for how much time and effort is put into making a large scale website, and I don't even have the pressure of the thought that an actual business would be waiting to use this website one day.
